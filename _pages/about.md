Welcome! I'm a first year PhD student at Boston University advised by [Prof.
Derry Wijaya](https://derrywijaya.github.io/). My research interests so far have hovered around multilingual and/or low-resource learning. 

Currently, we're looking into providing multimodal input for transformer based pretrained language models(such as [BERT](https://huggingface.co/transformers/model_doc/bert.html)), as well as using graph neural networks for improved low resource text classification.
